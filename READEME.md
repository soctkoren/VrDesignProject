Answer 4: I would change the color of the blue light to pink or purple. 

Analysis of User Test:

The user seems to be interested in the vr experience, however, this is her 2nd vr experience so the bar is pretty low.
One interesting thing is that the user is able to detect their own height very clearly and commented on that difference based on the
room size. The orbs was another interesting thing that user pointed out. Because of the spot light it was obvious that something needed
to be done with it, but at this point of the game they are not really interative so the suer was confused.
