Question 1: Tell me about the room size.
Answer 1: The room looks scary, but well lit. The Size of the room seems good, but I feel a little shorter than I normally am.

Question 2: Tell me about the objects you see.
Answer 2: Most of the items are interesting. The barrels are cute, but the little ones look very small. I also noticed the orbs right away. Not sure what they do but they are cool. 

Question 3: Is there anything wierd you notice about the room.
Answer 3: Not really. I don't see anything through the doors. So I actually don't know which way is front or back.

Question 4: If there is one thing you would want to change or add what would it be?
Answer 4: I would change the color of the blue light to pink or purple. 

Analysis of User Test:

The user seems to be interested in the vr experience, however, this is her 2nd vr experience so the bar is pretty low.
One interesting thing is that the user is able to detect their own height very clearly and commented on that difference based on the
room size. The orbs was another interesting thing that user pointed out. Because of the spot light it was obvious that something needed
to be done with it, but at this point of the game they are not really interative so the suer was confused.

User Testing GUI Notes:
Name: Andrew Keturi
Experience in VR: Medium

Question 1: Do you see any canvas? 
Yes, I see a black canvas. It looks like a welcome message and a start gui

Question 2: How do you think you can interacte with the screen?
I like how the pointer is green and when I interacte with what looks like the button, it highlights in a light green color. Very similar to
how websites would work. If I click on it it would probably start the game

Question 3: Tell me about the canvas, is there anything you would change about them?
Hmm the I don't really like the black canvas. It's very bland. It is also a little big and I wish I can see part of the game behind it.

Question 4: Click on the start button, and tell me about the new canvas.
The new canavs looks like it's there to restart the game. Pretty straight foward.
